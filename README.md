# ad-qolsys
AppDaemon app for Qolsys IQ Panel 2 _for Home Assistant_.  Only tested using the HA add-on AppDaemon.  Inspired by https://community.home-assistant.io/t/qolsys-iq-panel-2-and-3rd-party-integration

Fully self-contained AppDaemon app.  If you have HA MQTT Discovery turned on, you should end up with binary sensors for each `Door_Window` zone on the Qolsys panel. There are more zone types which I donâ€™t own so I have not handled them in anyway.

Youâ€™ll also have an `alarm_control_panel` device in HA for each partition in your Qolsys panel.

Arguments in apps.yaml:
```
# mqtt_namespace: (optional) namespace for mqtt defined in appdaemon.yaml; defaults to ""
# qolsys_host: (Required) IP address or hostname for the qolsys panel
# qolsys_port: (Optional) Port on the qolsys panel to connect to; will default to 12345
# qolsys_token: (Required) Token from the qolsys panel
# request_topic: (Optional) The topic to listen to send commands to the qolsys panel; defaults to qolsys/requests
# qolsys_timeout: (Optional) The timeout (in seconds) to wait for any activity to/from the qolsys panel before disconnecting; defaults to 86400
# qolsys_info_topic: (Optional) The topic to publish qolsys INFO events to; defaults to qolsys/info
# qolsys_zone_event_topic: (Optional) The topic to publish ZONE_EVENT events to; defaults to qolsys/zone_event
# qolsys_alarming_event_topic: (Optional) The topic to publish ARMING events to; defaults to qolsys/arming
# qolsys_disarming_event_topic: (Optional) The topic to publish DISARMING events to; defaults to qolsys/disarming
# qolsys_alarm_status_topic: (Optional) The topic to publish alarm status for the alarm_control_panel; defaults to qolsys/alarm/status
```
Youâ€™ll need you appdaemon's apps.yaml to include an app with this module and class:
```
qolsys_panel:
  module: qolsys_client
  class: QolsysClient
  mqtt_namespace: mqtt <see below for my config>
  qolsys_host: <your IP here>
  qolsys_token: <your token here>
  qolsys_port: 12345 # Optional
  request_topic: qolsys/requests # Optional
  qolsys_info_topic: qolsys/panel/info # Optional
  qolsys_zone_update_topic: qolsys/panel/zone_update # Optional
  qolsys_zone_event_topic: qolsys/panel/zone_event # Optional
  qolsys_alarming_event_topic: qolsys/panel/alarming # Optional
  qolsys_disarming_event_topic: qolsys/panel/disarm # Optional
  qolsys_alarm_status_topic: qolsys/alarm/status # Optional
```
As far MQTT is concerned, I had to figure out how to enable MQTT inside AppDaemon. In case youâ€™re new to AppDaemon and have the same questions, I had to put this in my appdaemon.yaml:
```
appdaemon:
  latitude: # existing
  longitude: # existing
  elevation: # existing
  time_zone: # your timezone America/Los_Angeles
  # HASS plugin is enabled by default if you're using the add-on
  plugins:
    HASS:
      type: hass
    # I added on the MQTT plugin
    MQTT:
      type: mqtt
      namespace: mqtt #you will need this namespace name in your apps.yaml
      # The IP Address or hostname of your MQTT broker.  
      client_host: 192.168.x.y
      client_port: 1883
```
Iâ€™m by no means an MQTT or AppDaemon expert, so feel free to peruse the documentation for any MQTT configuration help you need https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MQTT_API_REFERENCE.html.

You can send commands to the Qolsys panel on the `request_topic` in the config (or `qolsys/requests` if not specified).  There are four commands:
```
# Request the INFO to be published
{"event":"INFO", "token":"blah"}

# Arm stay:
{"event":"ARM", "arm_type":"stay", "partition_id": 0, "token":"blah"}

# Arm away
{"event":"ARM", "arm_type":"away", "partition_id": 0, "token":"blah"}

# Disarm
{"event":"DISARM", "usercode":"0000", "token":"blah"}
```
Known issues:

- When the app reloads, sometimes it doesnâ€™t reconnect to the socket and it just hangs the entire app. The only way Iâ€™ve been able to recover is to restart AppDaemon. If anyone has a way to detect and fix this, let me know or issue a pull request.

~- Iâ€™m not yet processing arming/disarming events. The requests will work ðŸ’¯, but the partition doesnâ€™t get updated with the status. I put in another INFO request so the partition sensor will update but itâ€™s a bit hacky for now. If youâ€™re listening to the topics or watching logs, youâ€™ll see a bunch of noise associated with this hack.~

~- Partition status being tracked as a `binary_sensor` instead of `alarm_control_panel`.~
- MQTT Discovery is being published to `homeassistant/binary_sensor`. Iâ€™ll make this a config in the future. This is the default MQTT Discovery topic so I think most people will be fine.

### I hope this works for everyone! Hit me up with feedback.
